    <h1>Welcome to the Nethercott Website</h1>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          I registered this domain back in April 2000, because I thought it would
          be nice to have a domain with my name. Back then, the Nethercott "brand"
          was quite rare and unique. You could search for <b>Nethercott</b> and only get a
          few results. The last time I looked, if you search for <b>Nethercott</b> in Google,
          you get 153,000 results! At the top of the Nethercott brand (according to Google)
          you have funeral directors, a farm, an opticians, and of course the footballer Stuart Nethercott.

        <h3>Places</h3>
        <p>
          There are also quite a few places with the name <b>Nethercott</b>. There seem to be quite a lot down
          in Devon, but I have also noticed that there are places in Oxford, Cornwall, and I even noticed there
          was a <b>Nethercott Close</b> in Luton!

        <h3>Meaning</h3>
        <p>
          From what I can make out the name <b>Nethercott</b> means <b>lower house that went with the job</b>
          (apparently cott isn't short for cottage as you might think). So maybe my ancestors were wealthy
          land owners then? Well, apparently not. Rural dwellings in those days were pretty humble afairs
          - the rich land owners would have lived in what they called <b>halls</b>.
